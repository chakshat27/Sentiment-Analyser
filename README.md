## Features

- Perform sentiment analysis on text data.
- Utilize pre-trained models or train your own sentiment analysis model.
- Visualize sentiment distribution and trends.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- TextBlob
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your text data for analysis.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for sentiment analysis.
3. Explore sentiment distribution and trends.

## Data

Ensure your text data is in a format suitable for sentiment analysis. For example:

```
Text,Label
"I love this product!",Positive
"This movie is terrible.",Negative
...
```

## Methodology
